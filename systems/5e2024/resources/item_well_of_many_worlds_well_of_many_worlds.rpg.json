It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\n\nYou can take a Magic action to unfold the Well of Many Worlds and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. The portal remains open until a creature within 5 feet of it takes a Magic action to close it by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.\n\nOnce the Well of Many Worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.795189"},"id":"06e84aa2-b9c3-4ff5-b5d6-3fa3be91a59e"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.795194"},"id":"2ffc3044-32ef-4638-ac03-1f944bd5c022"}}},"rarity":{"value":"legendary"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.795196"},"id":"well_of_many_worlds"}}
