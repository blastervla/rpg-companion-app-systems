You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attackerâ€™s, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.\n\nIf you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it."},"classes":{"value":["artificer__eb_","druid","warlock","blood_hunter"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.668242"},"id":"0e263423-353f-44e6-b983-2ba934bb7478"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.668247"},"id":"0f53eac3-36d0-4bf0-9685-644252d2bc3e"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.668251"},"id":"5f4831a6-c2b8-4d92-a00e-07f53b92d4f6"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.668254"},"id":"magic_stone"}}
