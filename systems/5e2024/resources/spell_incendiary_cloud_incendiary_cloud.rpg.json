The cloud's area is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.\n\nWhen the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.\n\nThe cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns"},"classes":{"value":["sorcerer","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":8},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":10},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640440"},"id":"43339305-524e-43aa-ba43-32172400a8e7"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"fire"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640445"},"id":"21030522-cbce-4ca3-af8a-9bf5ae2a29d9"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640450"},"id":"24dbe35a-a9ae-4a8b-9212-e8c3dd56b002"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640453"},"id":"incendiary_cloud"}}
