When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.\nThis trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.\nThe trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spellâ€™s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.\nA restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.\nAfter the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it"},"classes":{"value":["artificer__eb_","druid","ranger","ranger__revised__","revised_ranger","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.681013"}}}
