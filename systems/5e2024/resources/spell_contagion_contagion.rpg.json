If the target succeeds on three of these saves, the spell ends on the target. If the target fails three of the saves, the spell lasts for 7 days on it.\n\nWhenever the Poisoned target receives an effect that would end the Poisoned condition, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the Poisoned condition doesn't end on it"},"classes":{"value":["cleric","druid"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.649593"},"id":"contagion"}}
