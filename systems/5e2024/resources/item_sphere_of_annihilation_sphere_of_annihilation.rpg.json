{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Sphere of Annihilation"},"source":{"value":"dmg"},"description":{"value":"This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\n\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.\n\nControlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.\n\nWhile in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.\n\nSphere Interactions. If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.\n\n1d100 --> Result\n01-50 --> The sphere is destroyed.\n51-85 --> The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.\n86-00 --> A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649302"},"id":"363a6a39-b933-4b94-bf3b-c1d25290df23"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649307"},"id":"3347d840-db0e-4cd3-8dc5-cd6ce68fb79f"}}},"rarity":{"value":"legendary"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649309"},"id":"sphere_of_annihilation"}}
