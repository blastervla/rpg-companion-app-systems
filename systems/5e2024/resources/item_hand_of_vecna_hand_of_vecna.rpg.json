{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Hand of Vecna"},"source":{"value":"dmg"},"description":{"value":"Vecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.\n\nA treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.\n\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.\n\nRandom Properties of the Eye and Hand. The Hand of Vecna has the following random properties:\n\n- 1 minor beneficial property\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n\nAttuning to the Hand. To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\n\nProperties of the Hand. When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n\nGreat Strength. Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher.\n\nIcy Touch. Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit.\n\nSpellcasting. The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Hand of Vecna Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts Suggestion on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.\n\nHand of Vecna Spells\nSpell --> Charge Cost\nFinger of Death --> 5\nSleep --> 1\nSlow --> 2\nTeleport --> 3\n\nDestroying the Eye and Hand. If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700875"},"id":"033de383-5e09-4d7e-bfdb-7e4e61f5203a"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700880"},"id":"a181e1e2-4392-49ee-9cd7-14f4cf87bd9d"}}},"rarity":{"value":"artifact"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"type":{"value":"set_stat"},"constant":{"value":20},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700895"},"id":"3e1417e1-ac56-4fa5-acbc-46cf3efed9ac"}},{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":8},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"constant":{"value":4},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700904"},"id":"0de2f2c6-806b-474b-8f34-41d400d94cdb"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700910"},"id":"bdab48e1-c971-4be2-a985-0daf69dd77ad"}},{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast Finger of Death (5 Charges)"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"1bbe7c32-0e6b-412f-aaaf-7c2dff462a8c"}}},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"id":"dc029e38-de69-4b07-a687-e961b9167da6"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Finger of Death"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_7"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_necromancy"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"60 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Instantaneous"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"description":{"value":"You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range.

If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.\n\nTeleportation Outcome\nFamiliarity --> Mishap --> Similar Area --> Off Target --> On Target\nPermanent circle --> _ --> _ --> _ --> 01-00\nLinked object --> _ --> _ --> _ --> 01-00\nVery familiar --> 01-05 --> 06-13 --> 14-24 --> 25-00\nSeen casually --> 01-33 --> 34-43 --> 44-53 --> 54-00\nViewed once or described --> 01-43 --> 44-53 --> 54-73 --> 74-00\nFalse destination --> 01-50 --> 51-00 --> _ --> _\nFamiliarity. Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:\n\n- \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.\n- \"Linked object\" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.\n- \"Very familiar\" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.\n- \"Seen casually\" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.\n- \"Viewed once or described\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\n- \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.\n\nMishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.\n\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.\n\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended"},"classes":{"value":["bard","wizard","sorcerer"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.646218"},"id":"8a25802b-b4de-45c7-9d9e-173a989c20e9"}}},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700941"},"id":"d5eb0b8b-54b8-4d9d-8312-42e7848b7ee6"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700943"},"id":"hand_of_vecna"}}
