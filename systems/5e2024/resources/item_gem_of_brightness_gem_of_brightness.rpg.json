While you are holding it, you can take a Magic action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\n\nFirst Command Word. The gem sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.\n\nSecond Command Word. You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nThird Command Word. You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.\n\nWhen all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786256"},"id":"05dd9656-d76b-46af-9416-645874432718"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786260"},"id":"c86c2392-d0b6-4433-b021-d6b7527b023a"}}},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"manual"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":50},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":0},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786268"},"id":"719d8b81-8970-41fd-bbc7-100741530ed7"}}},"type":{"value":"none"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786273"},"id":"5475ade4-9880-4742-bdbb-14154026355f"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786275"},"id":"gem_of_brightness"}}
