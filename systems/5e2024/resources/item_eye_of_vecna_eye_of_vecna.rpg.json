{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Eye of Vecna"},"source":{"value":"dmg"},"description":{"value":"Vecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.\n\nA treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.\n\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.\n\nRandom Properties of the Eye and Hand. The Eye of Vecna has the following random properties:\n\n- 1 minor beneficial property\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n\nAttuning to the Eye. To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\n\nProperties of the Eye. While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n\nTruesight. You have Truesight out to 240 feet.\n\nSpellcasting. The eye has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.\n\nSpell --> Charge Cost\nClairvoyance --> 2\nCrown of Madness --> 1\nDisintegrate --> 4\nDominate Monster --> 5\nEyebite --> 4\n\nX-ray Vision. You can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\n\nDestroying the Eye and Hand. If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.762071"},"id":"9f750531-119f-465e-9833-37fba6d0a55f"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.762076"},"id":"dd146d1b-5580-4310-adab-06ec41e94129"}}},"rarity":{"value":"artifact"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":8},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"constant":{"value":4},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.762084"},"id":"d93bd9ab-e905-49df-95a2-8bd23356f3a4"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.762090"},"id":"63520b4b-1c52-4a81-82fc-04609bea05dd"}},{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast Clairvoyance (2 Charges)"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"0436d3d9-4280-402b-8b45-cb11dbc37d36"}}},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"id":"77bd3c97-7dad-4aa6-997a-208b53bd4ac5"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Clairvoyance"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_3"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_divination"},"casting_time":{"value":"10 minutes"},"range":{"value":"1 mile"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 10 minutes"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a focus worth at least 100gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing"},"description":{"value":"You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees).
