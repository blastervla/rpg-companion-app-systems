{"resource_id":"item","stats":{"id":"scorpion_ship","name":{"value":"Scorpion Ship"},"source":{"value":"aag"},"description":{"value":"Scorpion ships are archaic metal warships that have never lost their popularity, largely because of their versatility. Articulated legs enable a scorpion ship to land safely on the ground and move across a solid surface at a walking speed of 30 feet. The ship can't float on water, however. A ballista is mounted on the top deck, and a mangonel is perched on the end of the tail. The ship's two claws are relatively inefficient in combat, but a claw that grabs a creature can quickly take it out of action."},"type":{"value":"vehicle_space"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":2500.0},"unit":{"value":"platinum"},"id":"0e9bbec7-a18f-40a1-a219-c69c60888b69","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.663798"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"20c8fffd-68fa-404d-a95f-a6d55e1722cb","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.663803"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.663806"}}}
