A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.\n\nStandard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistaeâ€”one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram."},"type":{"value":"vehicle_space"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":2000.0},"unit":{"value":"platinum"},"id":"9c7a5187-0d72-41d4-af06-476993ae2fd8","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.809409"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"df840de4-371b-47f8-9736-648fe3ca0ff1","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.809414"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.809417"}}}
