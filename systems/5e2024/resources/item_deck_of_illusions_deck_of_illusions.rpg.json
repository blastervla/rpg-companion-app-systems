{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Deck of Illusions"},"source":{"value":"dmg"},"description":{"value":"This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.\n\nAny physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.\n\n1d100 --> Illusion\n01-03 --> Adult Red Dragon\n04-06 --> Archmage\n07-09 --> Assassin\n10-12 --> Bandit Captain\n13-15 --> Beholder\n16-18 --> Berserker\n19-21 --> Bugbear Warrior\n22-24 --> Cloud Giant\n25-27 --> Druid\n28-30 --> Erinyes\n31-33 --> Ettin\n34-36 --> Fire Giant\n37-39 --> Frost Giant\n40-42 --> Gnoll Warrior\n43-45 --> Goblin Warrior\n46-48 --> Guardian Naga\n49-51 --> Hill Giant\n52-54 --> Hobgoblin Warrior\n55-57 --> Incubus\n58-60 --> Iron Golem\n61-63 --> Knight\n64-66 --> Kobold Warrior\n67-69 --> Lich\n70-72 --> Medusa\n73-75 --> Night Hag\n76-78 --> Ogre\n79-81 --> Oni\n82-84 --> Priest\n85-87 --> Succubus\n88-90 --> Troll\n91-93 --> Warrior Veteran\n94-96 --> Wyvern\n97-00 --> The card drawer"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.659437"},"id":"4118ec7f-ed62-4756-8ac0-a1c6da933e77"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.659442"},"id":"f36c8bb7-d632-4546-9356-a361102fa0d9"}}},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.659445"},"id":"deck_of_illusions"}}
