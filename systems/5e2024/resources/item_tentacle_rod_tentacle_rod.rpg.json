{"resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Tentacle Rod"},"source":{"value":"dmg"},"description":{"value":"Made by the drow, this rod is a magic weapon that ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."},"type":{"value":"rod"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.711388"},"id":"dfbdce71-196e-4576-bcaa-cf8ef76c7152"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":2},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.711393"},"id":"0627641b-0048-4096-8661-355e10e3591c"}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.711395"},"id":"tentacle_rod"}}
