It typically incorporates imagery of dragons' wings, claws, teeth, or scales.\n\nYou have advantage on initiative rolls. While you are holding the focus, it can function as a spellcasting focus for all your spells.\n\nThe focus gains an additional property determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Stirring:\n\nWhenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you.\n\nWhile you are holding a Wakened focus, you can use it to cast certain spells. Once the item is used to cast a given spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells are determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Wakened.\n\n- Rary's telepathic bond, Raulothim's psychic lance\n\nWhen you cast a spell of 1st level or higher while holding this focus, you can treat the spell as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.794297"},"id":"af1b81c5-8e6e-4a9f-b7b4-c622fe5b7a01"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.794301"},"id":"7eb28e6a-f109-4eb0-aca7-a7210f8512cc"}}},"rarity":{"value":"legendary"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"type":{"value":"advantage"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.initiative"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.794310"},"id":"5887b73c-c2a8-43de-9812-b3086b741ae6"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.794335"},"id":"wakened_gem_dragon-touched_focus"}}
