If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the bestiary for the creature's stats.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.\n\nCarnelian Triceratops\nThis figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 10 days have passed."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"0e05ee4e-2490-479e-bef4-47f730aeb9cf","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.681756"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"0048266f-d2da-4c7d-b93d-50e97b32d202","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.681761"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Uses Left"},"trigger_type":{"value":"passive"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"long_rest"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":0},"id":"fe05fd2b-5fd5-497e-8e78-198dc8fb276c","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.681770"}}}},"type":{"value":"none"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"id":"17a5756e-f553-46a2-b20e-ff6cb11aa4fb","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.681775"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.681777"}}}
