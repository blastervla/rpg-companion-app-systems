You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells.

The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.
