{"resource_id":"item","stats":{"id":"spell_bottle","name":{"value":"Spell Bottle"},"source":{"value":"egw"},"description":{"value":"This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.\n\nWhen the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.\n\nWhile holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.\n\nIf you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0.0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"edf47a31-e923-4519-a005-4cd0277f3b6a","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700606"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":8.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"239a3531-116b-49ce-ba0b-d3dd62ee65ba","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700611"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"legendary"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.700613"}}}
