The illusory experience is fleeting and harmless, however real it might feel in the moment.\n\nRecord Sensation\nYou can use your reaction to record a short sensation lasting no longer than 6 seconds experienced by a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, infusing the essence of that experience into the stone. This replaces any sensation already stored within the stone.\n\nSiphon Sensation\nAs a bonus action, you can draw on the stone's magic to end the charmed or frightened condition on yourself, destroying the stone in the process."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"db278560-de58-4e18-8077-acec865881c4","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.697642"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"a2d8f963-482e-49ac-81f0-4f5e519ec7ef","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.697647"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.697650"}}}
