Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.\n\nYou can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\n\nYou can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\nAll instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good.\n\nIn addition, the Fochlucan bandore can be used to cast entangle, faerie fire, shillelagh, and speak with animals."},"type":{"value":"instrument"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.731619"},"id":"443d82f0-cab3-469e-9247-6bcef420397f"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":2.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.731623"},"id":"a7dc67e5-81b8-4b54-b711-4fb318e80e91"}}},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Use Fly"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"778c5eaa-fc76-4b7e-af9e-bc65f713c9cc"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.731631"},"id":"4617758c-9fc6-4287-abf3-8f982f03594c"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Fly"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_3"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_transmutation"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"Touch"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 10 minutes"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a wing feather from any bird"},"description":{"value":"You touch a willing creature.
