You can expend its charges to use the properties below.\n\nFaerie Fire. You can expend 1 charge to cast Faerie Fire from the ring.\n\nLightning Spheres. You can expend 2 charges as a Magic action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.\n\nEach sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute.

The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.\n\nNumber of Spheres --> Lightning Damage\n1 --> 4d12\n2 --> 5d4\n3 --> 2d6\n4 --> 2d4\nShooting Stars.
