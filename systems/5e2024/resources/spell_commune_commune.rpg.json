You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.\n\nDivine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \"unclear\" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\n\nIf you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer"},"classes":{"value":["cleric"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.648571"},"id":"commune"}}
