On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands to the target (no action required), such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Move over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" The target does its best to obey on its turn. If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself.\n\nYou can command the target to take a Reaction but must take your own Reaction to do so"},"higher_level_description":{"value":"Your Concentration can last longer with a level 9 spell slot (up to 8 hours)"},"classes":{"value":["bard","sorcerer","warlock","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.639386"},"id":"dominate_monster"}}
