The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.\n\nThe copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.\n\nThe bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.\n\nHelpful Hand\nAs an action, you can use the bracelet to cast Bigby's hand as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require concentration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736159"},"id":"7a162f43-4177-4489-86d6-bafd57d2587c"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736164"},"id":"3c21b3be-a9f0-4880-b6b5-906b0c9a170e"}}},"rarity":{"value":"artifact"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Create Copy Uses"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":3},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":3},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736172"},"id":"e4d35c48-c487-430c-98ab-3a50e8f452d7"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736178"},"id":"ba948305-2c46-47c3-a69f-98ea858f76be"}},{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"755d6a80-c22d-48e2-801d-b07dd558bf14"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736185"},"id":"8488f3a2-27dd-4ad3-82a7-d5477c93ea4e"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Bigby's Hand"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_5"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_evocation"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"120 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 1 minute"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"an eggshell and a glove"},"description":{"value":"You create a Large hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
