Additionally, when you move within 5 feet of a creature, you can cause the cloak's cold wind to buffet the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and have the prone condition. A creature can be affected by the mantle only once during a turn.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs an action, you can invoke the mantle's rune to cast the sleet storm spell (save DC 14) with it. When you use the mantle to cast the spell, the area of the spell isn't 3 for you, and you can see through the storm, ignoring the normal penalties of a heavily obscured area.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.683436"},"id":"caa4e6b9-e16b-4bd8-87ed-972d81a436f1"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.683441"},"id":"7cc746ba-ad81-4a54-b3da-255d8463468a"}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Invoke Rune"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"24ac9174-33fc-4ddc-8b8c-aa4b601a7603"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.683449"},"id":"dd9a1fc3-0ed2-43f9-8083-587f97f5d40e"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Sleet Storm"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_3"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_conjuration"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"150 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 1 minute"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a miniature umbrella"},"description":{"value":"Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range.
