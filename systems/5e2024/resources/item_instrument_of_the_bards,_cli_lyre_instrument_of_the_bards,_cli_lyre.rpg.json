This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\nAll instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good.\n\nIn addition, the Cli lyre can be used to cast stone shape, wall of fire, and wind wall."},"type":{"value":"instrument"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.741691"},"id":"6e175389-c0b8-4929-9bcb-91f9eb497799"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":2.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.741696"},"id":"beee3c25-ab4b-4b79-8b46-045371f42640"}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Use Fly"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"0b9412f8-0191-4457-866b-dcfc689b7e0e"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.741703"},"id":"93e1b41b-08d2-477d-8f01-73531508093a"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Fly"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_3"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_transmutation"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"Touch"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 10 minutes"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a wing feather from any bird"},"description":{"value":"You touch a willing creature.
