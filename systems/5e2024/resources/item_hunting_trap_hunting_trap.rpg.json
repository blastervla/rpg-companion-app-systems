{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Hunting Trap"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"description":{"value":"As a Utilize action, you can set a Hunting Trap, which is a sawtooth steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 Piercing damage and have its Speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 Piercing damage to the trapped creature"},"type":{"value":"adventuring_gear"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":5.0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.720889"},"id":"703a43b0-cd1b-4d25-aab7-263a8bb2b4d3"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":25},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.720893"},"id":"2a462cf4-7fe3-4cf2-8334-a99242e62e96"}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.720896"},"id":"hunting_trap"}}
