Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nChanging your Prepared Spells.
