Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.\n\nWhen you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones orbiting your head at the same time.\n\nEach Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.\n\nAs a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.\n\nYour Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere orbits your head"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649482"},"id":"6b04af62-00c5-4d4a-9644-0388f16ca2d9"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649487"},"id":"c2426117-97a5-4282-b49e-d12be97ab164"}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Use"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":false},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":0},"type":{"value":"add_to_stat"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.dexterity_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_modifier"},"dice_roll":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":2},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649496"},"id":"6e0195c4-1436-4f25-a65f-eeb55e4a0ec4"}}},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649503"},"id":"387edbb6-db37-4766-b7c8-e68215b3080c"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.649505"},"id":"ioun_stone,_agility"}}
