While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.\n\nRegaining Charges. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.\n\nMastery: Topple. If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"86c0a901-3bcf-469e-878d-7182b3bad25f"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":4},"id":"bf20ae46-bee6-46b1-8b78-e8a19fd599cf"}}},"type":{"value":"quarterstaff"},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"id":"374426c6-07de-4697-b756-b373ec780572"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"id":"0f998ae5-07f1-4963-b0df-afbc77235162"}}]},"is_versatile":{"value":true},"versatile_damage_dice":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"id":"480759c4-df62-4aca-9b0e-0e82ee09bb06"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"id":"d5ea63eb-9037-49c1-8535-4e83755cf01b"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"dc774d5b-2b1c-4bf1-a57c-ee38cf5ee8f5"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":10},"recharges":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"constant":{"value":4},"id":"138c93eb-e76d-4322-a983-8004e3548709"}}},"id":"6900ef36-34b1-4fea-a545-1ad9621b30fe"}}]},"id":"e14247e4-2a62-4232-b217-a12d0ed4f7c2"}}
