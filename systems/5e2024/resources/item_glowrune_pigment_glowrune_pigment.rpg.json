This magical paint bestows temporary magical gifts on creatures with runes drawn on their skin with this paint.\n\nOne paint pot contains enough pigment to paint one rune. A creature can spend 10 minutes to paint one of the following runes onto itself or another creature:\n\nJourney Rune\n3 doesn't cost the painted creature extra movement.\n\nLife Rune\nThe painted creature gains 10 temporary hit points and has advantage on death saving throws.\n\nLight Rune\nThe painted creature gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet. If the painted creature already has darkvision from another source, the range of its darkvision increases by 30 feet.\n\nMountain Rune\nThe painted creature is immune to being knocked prone and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws.\n\nShield Rune\nThe painted creature has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that deal damage.\n\nA creature can benefit from only one painted rune at a time, so a new rune painted on a creature has no effect unless the old one is removed first. The rune's benefits last for 8 hours or until the painted creature uses its action to wipe away the rune."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"2cecc21b-f263-4d88-80e7-e1770d029e7d","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.630904"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"95b9e84a-3b76-4ceb-9fe7-3e2d34d80423","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.630909"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.630912"}}}
