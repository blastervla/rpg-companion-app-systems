Until the spell ends, you canâ€™t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.\n- You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.\n- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d12 force damage.\n- You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.\n- You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.\n- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.\n\nImmediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion"},"classes":{"value":["wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":6},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":2},"dice_type":{"value":"d12"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.693024"},"id":"97119fc7-3373-4d6d-a48c-34e80f238385"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"force"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.693029"},"id":"e5ddcea9-d207-4142-bbbc-a8923f3c3362"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.693033"},"id":"81b023e4-d37c-4ee3-9e18-c355e2646567"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.693036"},"id":"tensers_transformation"}}
