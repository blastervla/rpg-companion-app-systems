For 5 minutes, Humanoids can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that an Humanoid would be inside the area, the effect ends.\n\nAs a Magic action, a creature within 5 feet of the Emanation can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.
