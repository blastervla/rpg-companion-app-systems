While wearing or holding this item, you can expend 1 charge to cast Darkvision (targeting yourself only) or See Invisibility. The Hag Eye regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nCoven Sensor. The Hag Eye is usually entrusted to a hag's minion for safekeeping and transport. As a Magic action, a hag who belongs to the coven that created the Hag Eye can see what the Hag Eye sees if the hag and the Hag Eye are on the same plane of existence. This effect lasts as long as the hag maintains Concentration. Multiple hags in the coven can see through the Hag Eye simultaneously.\n\nCreating a Hag Eye. Only a hag coven can craft this item, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or another wearable item. A hag coven can have only one Hag Eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it if one or more of them has the Incapacitated condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"cost","stats":{"id":"83079a19-522a-41d8-a850-891061a277db"}}},"weight":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"weight","stats":{"id":"15f1ddd2-53e5-4ab1-97c8-4b3b073bc359"}}},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"1893f762-416f-4b0d-9644-f42641910e37"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":3},"id":"700553e1-c65f-4d5f-853b-15e34ded3e5a"}},{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast darkvision"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"e71f1ede-a509-410f-ba1f-009fbcbe5695"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Darkvision"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_2"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_transmutation"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"Touch"},"duration":{"value":"8 hours"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a dried carrot"},"description":{"value":"For the duration, a willing creature you touch has Darkvision with a range of 150 feet"},"classes":{"value":["druid","ranger","sorcerer","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.638036"},"id":"7dfde070-6d98-4fe2-9eeb-08f4958ced43"}}},"id":"31b3641a-c84c-49ed-b59f-8bebba9add6f"}},{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast see invisibility"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"4a587625-0d0c-47ec-a5f9-0c237f9ded9c"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"system":"5e2024","resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"See Invisibility"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_2"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_divination"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"Self"},"duration":{"value":"1 hour"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a pinch of talc"},"description":{"value":"For the duration, you see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane.
