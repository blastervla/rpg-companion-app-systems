The spell lasts for the duration.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:\n\n- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.\n- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it.\n- Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\n- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.\n- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\n- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.\n\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled"
