The table below shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of 1st+ Level. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. Charm Person, Disguise Self, and Fog Cloud are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability.
