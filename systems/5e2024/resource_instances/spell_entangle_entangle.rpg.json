They disappear when the spell ends.\n\nEach creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer Restrained by them"
