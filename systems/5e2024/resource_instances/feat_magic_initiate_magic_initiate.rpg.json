Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells (choose when you select this feat).\n\nLevel 1 Spell. Choose a level 1 spell from the same list you selected for this feat's cantrips. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.\n\nSpell Change. Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat with a different spell of the same level from the chosen spell list.\n\nRepeatable. You can take this feat more than once, but you must choose a different spell list each time"
