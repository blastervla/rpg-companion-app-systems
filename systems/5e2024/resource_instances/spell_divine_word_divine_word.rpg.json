Regardless of its Hit Points, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend target that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to the current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a Wish spell.\n\nHit Points --> Effect\n0-20 --> The target dies.\n21-30 --> The target has the Blinded, Deafened, and Stunned conditions for 1 hour.\n31-40 --> The target has the Blinded and Deafened conditions for 10 minutes.\n41-50 --> The target has the Deafened condition for 1 minute"
