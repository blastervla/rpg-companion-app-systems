      "value": "With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the Invisible condition and can't be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.\n\nIf the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.\n\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \"after 1,000 years\" or \"when the tarrasque awakens.\" This spell also ends if the target takes any damage"
