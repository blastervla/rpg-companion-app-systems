      "value": "(requires attunement by a druid or warlock)\n\nThis Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.\n\nYou can use the cauldron as a Spellcasting Focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the Scrying spell.\n\nBrew Potion. When you finish a Long Rest, you can use the cauldron to create a Potion of Healing (greater), which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.\n\nRaise Dead. As a Magic action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a Magic action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.\n\nIf you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by Raise Dead at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days"
