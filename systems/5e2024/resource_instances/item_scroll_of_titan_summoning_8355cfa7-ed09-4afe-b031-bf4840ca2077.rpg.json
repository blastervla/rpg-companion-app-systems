The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below.\n\nThe titan is Hostile toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points. If the titan is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.\n\n1d100 --> Titan\n01-15 --> Animal Lord\n16-30 --> Blob of Annihilation\n31-45 --> Colossus\n46-60 --> Elemental Cataclysm\n61-75 --> Empyrean\n76-90 --> Kraken (a kraken requires a body of water large enough to contain it, or the summoning fails and the scroll is wasted)\n91-100 --> Tarrasque"
