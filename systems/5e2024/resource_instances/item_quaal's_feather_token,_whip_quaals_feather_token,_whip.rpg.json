You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition"
