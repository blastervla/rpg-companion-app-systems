If the target fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.\n\nCreatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell"
