As a Magic action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.\n\nGate. Pressing one side of the cube, you cast Gate, opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.\n\nPlane Shift. Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast Plane Shift, transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side"
