This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death.\n\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival\u2014its head, for instance\u2014the spell automatically fails.\n\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal.
