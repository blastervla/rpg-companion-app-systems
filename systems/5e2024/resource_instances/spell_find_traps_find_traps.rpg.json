Thus, the spell would sense the Alarm or Glyph of Warding spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\n\nThis spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense"
