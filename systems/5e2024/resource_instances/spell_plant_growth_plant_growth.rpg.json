      "value": "This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.\n\nOvergrowth. Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.\n\nEnrichment. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one Plant Growth per year"
