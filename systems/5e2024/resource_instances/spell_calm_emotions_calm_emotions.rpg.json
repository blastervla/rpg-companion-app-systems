If the creature was already Charmed or Frightened, those conditions are suppressed for the duration.\n- The creature becomes Indifferent about creatures of your choice that it's Hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the creature's attitude returns to normal"
