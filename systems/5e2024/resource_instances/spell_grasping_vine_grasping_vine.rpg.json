The vine lasts for the duration.\n\nMake a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required).\n\nAs a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine"
