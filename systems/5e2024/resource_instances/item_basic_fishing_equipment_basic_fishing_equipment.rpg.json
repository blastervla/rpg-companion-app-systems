      "value": "Basic Fishing Equipment includes a pole, a line, a hook, and either a lure or some bait.\n\nFishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn't possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed. At the end of each hour spent fishing, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. On a successful check, roll a d10 and consult the Fishing table to determine the catch.\n\nd10 --> Catch\n1\u20132 --> Tiny, inedible fish (a creature that consumes it is poisoned for 1 hour)\n3\u20135 --> Tiny, edible fish (feeds one person)\n6\u20138 --> Small, edible fish (feeds up to four people)\n9 --> Hostile space eel (feeds up to twelve people)\n10 --> Hostile gray scavver (feeds up to twenty people), some other creature of the DM's choosing, or an Tiny object of the DM's choosing"
