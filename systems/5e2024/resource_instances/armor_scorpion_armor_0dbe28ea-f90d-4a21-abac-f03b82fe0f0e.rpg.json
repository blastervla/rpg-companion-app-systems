      "value": "This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:\n\nThe armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated.\nThe armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nThe armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat.\n\nCurse. This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (10d10 + 45) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a wish spell can remove the armor's curse"
