The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport, and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your destination space.\n\nIf you, the other creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails"
