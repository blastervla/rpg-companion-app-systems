      "value": "The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.\n\nThe sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.\n\nWhile attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):\n\n- You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.\n- You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.\n- At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.\n\nTransfer Attunement\nYou can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends.\n\nCost of a Spelljamming Helm\nA spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.\n\nWildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes, typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more."
