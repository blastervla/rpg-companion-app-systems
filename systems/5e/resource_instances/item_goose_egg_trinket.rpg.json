      "value": "Sometimes, an egg laid by a giant goose inexplicably contains some kind of small trinket or minor magic item. Once it lays a golden egg, a giant goose can't do so again for a year and a day.\n\nYou can use the Goose Egg Trinket table to determine the contents of a golden egg. A giant goose's egg can be a great way to give characters an item that's important to the story of an adventure or your campaign.\n\nGoose Egg Trinket\nd12 --> Egg Contents\n1 --> The egg is empty, but the inside of the shell is inscribed with a poem or an intricate illustration.\n2 --> The gold shell encloses a candy egg.\n3 --> The egg holds a small toy goose that makes a loud honking noise when squeezed.\n4 --> The egg contains a Potion of Hill Giant Strength with no container.\n5 --> The egg holds a pearl of power.\n6 --> The egg contains a brooch of shielding.\n7 --> The egg contains a Figurine of Wondrous Power, Silver Raven that activates automatically as the egg is opened, releasing what appears to be a living bird.\n8\u201312 --> The egg is empty."
