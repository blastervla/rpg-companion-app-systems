Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nIf the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours.
