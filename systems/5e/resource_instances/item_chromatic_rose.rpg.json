      "value": "This magic rose comes in one of five colors, as noted in the Chromatic Roses table. While a rose is held, it gains a harmless visual effect as indicated on the table.\n\nWhile holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to damage of the type associated with the rose's color. If you would take more than 10 damage of this type from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.\n\nAs an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of acid, lightning, poisonous gas, fire, or cold, as dictated by the rose's damage type. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 damage of the appropriate type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.\n\nChromatic Roses\nColor --> Visual Effect --> Damage Type\nBlack --> Drips acid --> Acid\nBlue --> Crackles with lightning --> Lightning\nGreen --> Issues green gas --> Poison\nRed --> Wreathed in fire --> Fire\nWhite --> Covered with frost --> Cold"
