If you switch Targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.\n\nCreature: You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your Spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is Restrained in your Telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.\n\nOn subsequent rounds, you can use your Action to attempt to maintain your Telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.\n\nObject: You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.\n\nIf the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your Spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.\n\nYou can exert fine control on Objects with your Telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the Contents from a vial"

It has a Strength of 26 and a Dexterity of 10. The hand doesn't fill its space.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, the hand can move up to 60 feet and cause one of the following effects:\n\n- Clenched Fist: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet. Make a melee spell attack using your statistics. On a successful hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.\n\n- Forceful Hand: The hand pushes a creature within 5 feet in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength against the target's Athletics. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet, plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting modifier. The hand moves with the target.\n\n- Grasping Hand: The hand grapples a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage. While grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand deal 2d6 + your spellcasting modifier of bludgeoning damage.\n\n- Interposing Hand: The hand places itself between you and a creature of your choice until you give it a different command. It moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover. The target can't move through the hand if its Strength is less than or equal to the hand's. If its score is higher than the hand's, the target can move toward you through the hand, but the space is difficult terrain."
