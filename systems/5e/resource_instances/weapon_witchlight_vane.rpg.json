      "value": "(requires attunement by a mister light or his handpicked successor)\n\nThis ornate rod is topped by a pair of butterfly wings and incorporates bits of red glass into its length. It weighs 3 pounds.\n\nMagic Weapon. In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the vane can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, the vane deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.\n\nSense Mood. While the vane is inside the perimeter of the Witchlight Carnival, it can sense the mood of every creature in the carnival that has an Intelligence of 4 or higher. As an action, a creature attuned to the vane can use it to pinpoint the location of the happiest creature in the carnival.\n\nThe butterfly shape at the top of the vane spins slowly clockwise when spirits in the carnival are generally high; if the general mood in the carnival is dour, the top of the vane spins slowly counterclockwise.\n\nSentience. The vane is a sentient, chaotic good wondrous item with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet, and it communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature attuned to it. Its purpose is to make sure everyone in the Witchlight Carnival is having a good time.\n\nAdditional Properties. The vane has the following additional properties:\n\n- The creature holding the vane has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\n- The creature attuned to the vane can't be blinded, deafened, petrified, or stunned.\n\n- While carrying the vane, the creature attuned to it can cast the dancing lights, polymorph, or ray of frost spell as an action, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability. After the vane's polymorph spell is cast, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the vane can't be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn"

A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.\n\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn\u2019t have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\n\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.\n\nAs long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.\n\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\n\nThe target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment."
