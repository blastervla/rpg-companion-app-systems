In addition, you have access to properties based on the Elemental Plane of Air.\n\nThe ring has 5 charges. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. Spells cast from the ring have a save DC of 17.\n\nYou can expend 2 of the ring's charges to cast dominate monster on an air elemental. In addition, when you fall, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. You can also speak and understand Auran.\n\nIf you help slay an air elemental while attuned to the ring, you gain access to the following additional properties:\n\n- You have resistance to lightning damage.\n- You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover.\n- You can cast the following spells from the ring, expending the necessary number of charges: chain lightning (3 charges), gust of wind (2 charges), or wind wall (1 charge)."

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\n\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\n\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell.
