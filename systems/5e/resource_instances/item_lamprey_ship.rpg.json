      "value": "Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use. Psurlons are particularly fond of them.\n\nUsing the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main deck.\n\nA lamprey can float on water, though it can't land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay."
