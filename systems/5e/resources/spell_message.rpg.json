The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\n\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings."},"classes":{"value":["artificer__eb_","artificer__revised_","bard","sorcerer","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.618894"}}}
