The device weighs 5 pounds and is covered with subtle etchings of planar sigils.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can toss the device into the air, whereupon it floats at a distance of 1d3 feet from you and you can access its properties. While the mimir is floating, a creature other than you can use an action to grasp or net the device, either by making a successful unarmed strike against AC 22 or a successful DC 22 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a bonus action to seize and stow the device.\n\nThe device has AC 22, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it is floating near you.\n\nEsoteric Knowledge\nWhile the device is floating, you can use an action to cast legend lore from the device. The device speaks the revealed lore aloud. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPlanar Knowledge\nThe device knows basic, useful information about the planes of existence. While the device is floating, it verbally answers questions you or anyone you designate poses to it about that topic. It knows the information about the planes as well as basic information about the gate-towns of the Outlands"},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"388b2fa5-e27d-4ce2-8e17-0127792018cf","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.616356"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":5.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"c2e263af-18dd-49cc-9f84-e9baa2f6175f","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.616362"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Esoteric Knowledge Uses Left"},"trigger_type":{"value":"passive"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"all"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":1},"id":"d351e610-2cef-4ddf-815c-007b06045f66","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.616373"}}}},"type":{"value":"none"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"id":"453425ee-48cb-4c57-816a-87455c823888","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.616380"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.616383"}}}
