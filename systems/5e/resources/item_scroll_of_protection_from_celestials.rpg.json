For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents celestials from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a celestial would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier."},"type":{"value":"scroll"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"d691e775-4249-4871-97e6-61a748874aa8","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.830782"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"9fc1e48b-66a4-4f1e-8335-9fb02ec2050f","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.830787"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.830789"}}}
