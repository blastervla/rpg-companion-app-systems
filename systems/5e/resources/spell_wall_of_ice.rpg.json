You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."},"classes":{"value":["fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":6},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":10},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.665348"},"id":"2370e4a5-c2c0-4595-89db-9d543bb8cc6e"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"cold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.665353"},"id":"f805bebc-7a6f-4885-b750-57284f53aa11"}},{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":5},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"id":"85d09eda-f442-4b6e-8ebc-3b4a9aa14be6"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"cold"},"id":"406f8a0a-8e3e-4ba7-96b9-0b0610cfd7f4"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.665357"},"id":"d6e86835-9c71-4d36-aaab-59002bbd9a18"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.665360"},"id":"wall_of_ice"}}
