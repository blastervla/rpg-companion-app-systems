Upon reaching 10th level, such a character has a 10 percent chance of gaining an epic boon. If the character fails to gain a boon, they have a 10 percent chance the next time they gain a level.\n\nIf the character gains a boon, the GM chooses it or determines it randomly. The character also permanently loses one of their Hit Dice, and their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to a roll of that die plus their Constitution modifier (minimum reduction of 1). This reduction can't be reversed by any means"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:28.394195"},"id":"9b2b6a26-d11d-4ed9-9af3-83dad30d5132"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"terms":{"value":[{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_and","stats":{"terms":{"value":[{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_term","stats":{"stat":{"value":"$character.constitution_score"},"condition":{"value":"lower_than"},"value":{"value":20.0},"id":"8712ac04-882b-4732-8df4-384790354cf2"}}]},"id":"20d99184-4f7d-42e8-828e-7fe7a3f278c3"}}]},"id":"020919ca-cd3d-4cd9-9e67-e2f033f894aa"}}},"type":{"value":"add_to_stat"},"stat":{"value":"$character.constitution_score"},"aggregation_type":{"value":"sum"},"constant":{"value":1},"id":"cd738925-e409-4482-b720-315a378f81c0"}}},"id":"da0db26d-9845-439e-83c3-27d6d4ad19cc"}},{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Learn a Cantrip"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"771e389d-534f-4469-9a97-de00e24e1d46"}}},"id":"ee7cb37e-a44a-4984-8b26-9e9897db4087"}}},"id":"5bd28910-fad7-4a34-af10-5fa041986e7b"}},{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast a Sorcering Spell"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"36685748-2414-4b1c-a332-e46ffcc1a747"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"id":"c6979495-884d-46ed-9d2e-fa3cce1c63ca"}}},"id":"a3dde528-6932-449a-b2dd-3df98a77a56d"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:28.394198"},"id":"aberrant_dragonmark__eb_"}}
