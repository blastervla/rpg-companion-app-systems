Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nA character can bind sticks of dynamite together so they explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) and the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).\n\nDynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll initiative for the dynamite. After the set number of rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that initiative."},"type":{"value":"explosive"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"128e41ee-7db6-40ed-86c6-7fe07bbb036b","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.647990"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"3c7d7e84-f942-4cd4-ac0a-e3ac009dfc8f","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.647995"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.647998"}}}
