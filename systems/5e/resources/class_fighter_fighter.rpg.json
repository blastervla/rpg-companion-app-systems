Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.\n\nFirearm Properties:\nFirearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones. Firearms are ranged weapons.\n\n- Reload: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.\n\n- Misfire: Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.\n\n- Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.\n\nAmmunition:\nAll firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.539938"},"id":"3fc239d0-60a8-4839-92a8-9e73aade0022"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.539939"},"id":"gunsmith"}},{"system":"5e","resource_id":"feat","stats":{"name":{"value":"Adept Marksman"},"descriptions":{"value":[{"system":"5e","resource_id":"levelled_description","stats":{"level":{"value":3},"description":{"value":"You learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.
