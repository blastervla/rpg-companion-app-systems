When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\n\nWhenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion."},"type":{"value":"ring"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.744664"},"id":"8b89160a-c174-42c2-ad28-a1e62ae8a0a0"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.744668"},"id":"0e71dcd6-e61a-4a95-9a49-067443f98182"}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Exhaustion Free Uses"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.744676"},"id":"17fc58fa-75c3-433d-acd8-f1d0b4c6f48b"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.744681"},"id":"dcbb4a1e-745b-460a-945e-d10fc3893b55"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.744682"},"id":"ring_of_x-ray_vision"}}
