Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.\n\nA stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\n\nYou can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"daaf4a17-efa5-4b65-b97e-81ac27b6367c","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.750218"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"3226c008-154f-481f-922a-3f387652f76e","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.750223"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.750226"}}}
