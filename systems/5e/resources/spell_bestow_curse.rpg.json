When you cast this spell, choose the Nature of the curse from the following options.\n\n- Choose one ability score. While Cursed, the target has disadvantage on Ability Checks and Saving Throws made with that ability score.\n\n- While Cursed, the target has disadvantage on Attack Rolls against you.\n\n- While Cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.\n\n- While the target is Cursed, your attacks and Spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.\n\nA Remove Curse spell ends this Effect.
