The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied\nspace that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Elemental Spirit stat block below. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature physically resembles a vaguely humanoid form wreathed in the chosen element, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action"},"higher_level_description":{"value":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell’s level in its stat block"},"classes":{"value":["druid","sorcerer","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.690587"}}}
