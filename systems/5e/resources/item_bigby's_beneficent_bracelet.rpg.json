The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.\n\nThe copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.\n\nThe bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.\n\nHelpful Hand\nAs an action, you can use the bracelet to cast Bigby's hand as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require concentration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736159"},"id":"7a162f43-4177-4489-86d6-bafd57d2587c"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736164"},"id":"3c21b3be-a9f0-4880-b6b5-906b0c9a170e"}}},"rarity":{"value":"artifact"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Create Copy Uses"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":3},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":3},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736172"},"id":"e4d35c48-c487-430c-98ab-3a50e8f452d7"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736178"},"id":"ba948305-2c46-47c3-a69f-98ea858f76be"}},{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"755d6a80-c22d-48e2-801d-b07dd558bf14"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.736185"},"id":"8488f3a2-27dd-4ad3-82a7-d5477c93ea4e"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Bigby's Hand"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_5"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_evocation"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"120 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 1 minute"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"Eggshell, snakeskin glove"},"description":{"value":"You create a Large hand of force in an unoccupied space that you can see.

It has a Strength of 26 and a Dexterity of 10. The hand doesn't fill its space.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, the hand can move up to 60 feet and cause one of the following effects:\n\n- Clenched Fist: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet. Make a melee spell attack using your statistics. On a successful hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.\n\n- Forceful Hand: The hand pushes a creature within 5 feet in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength against the target's Athletics. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet, plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting modifier. The hand moves with the target.\n\n- Grasping Hand: The hand grapples a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage. While grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand deal 2d6 + your spellcasting modifier of bludgeoning damage.\n\n- Interposing Hand: The hand places itself between you and a creature of your choice until you give it a different command. It moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover. The target can't move through the hand if its Strength is less than or equal to the hand's. If its score is higher than the hand's, the target can move toward you through the hand, but the space is difficult terrain."},"higher_level_description":{"value":"For each slot level above 5th,
