The command can be anything except something that would obviously cause the target to die.\n\nIf the creature can't understand you, this spell has no effect. If it can understand you, it must succeed a Wisdom save or become charmed by you. While the creature is charmed, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it does something that directly counters to your instructions, but no more than once each day.\n\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
