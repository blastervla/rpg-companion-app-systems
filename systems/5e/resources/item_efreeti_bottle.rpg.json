When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle.

After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.\n11-90 --> The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.\n91-00 --> The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"96eab4b1-e367-4822-9aef-2854515362e2","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.644982"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"20339bee-e1d4-4296-9406-b5013b002051","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.644988"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.644990"}}}
