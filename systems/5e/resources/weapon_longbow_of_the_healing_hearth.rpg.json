If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magic arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.\n\nThe bow has 8 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wielding the bow. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.\n\nCurative Arrow. When you take the Attack action using the bow, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your attacks with a blazing arrow of curative magic, which automatically hits one creature you can see within 150 feet of you. The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nIf the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn.\n\nSpellcasting. While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): create food and water (1 charge), warding bond (2 charges), guardian of faith (3 charges)"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"224b0f1a-fd90-4d29-9755-d0be89386191"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":2},"id":"3fb629ef-0a50-4942-aa55-5c3c2314be49"}}},"type":{"value":"longbow"},"attack_ability":{"value":"dexterity"},"rarity":{"value":"legendary"},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_simple":{"value":false},"is_two_handed":{"value":true},"is_heavy":{"value":true},"is_range":{"value":true},"range":{"value":"150/600"},"ammunition_type":{"value":"arrow"},"extra_attack_bonus":{"value":3},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"constant":{"value":3},"id":"3598f8aa-ddca-4605-a6f5-e625009ab4ce"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"piercing"},"id":"a5115a8a-bb8e-4f28-9e95-91ccf20f520f"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"c52aaf2a-6b63-4279-a07e-7d2e5c0ae0d3"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":8},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"constant":{"value":1},"id":"55f48bfb-d49f-469c-b4b1-f8cf80fddb3b"}}},"id":"1752fe7d-5e1c-42f5-a0bf-bf7c151ee4e0"}},{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Curative arrow (1 charge)"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"d47e2fc7-1341-4546-95d7-0df0449c93e6"}}},"id":"a427fc90-ccbe-4314-81de-46a8a812443c"}},{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast create food and water (1 charge)"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"3d51e49e-15e1-40db-bcaf-18f338627aa0"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Create Food and Water"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_3"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_conjuration"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"30 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Instantaneous"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"description":{"value":"You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours.
