If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.\n\nIf the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet.
