The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 1O-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nThe phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.\n\nThe target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.\n\nWhile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall--it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.\n\nAn affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly. a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature ar hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion."},"classes":{"value":["bard","sorcerer","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":2},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.661483"},"id":"16920f2e-0c29-4964-9ce5-d7e27f2aaa08"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"psychic"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.661488"},"id":"9531f5ac-129d-4456-aba5-851dd2fa3e70"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.661492"},"id":"0a5215d3-0bd6-41f1-b77d-be1000af08f8"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.661495"},"id":"phantasmal_force"}}
