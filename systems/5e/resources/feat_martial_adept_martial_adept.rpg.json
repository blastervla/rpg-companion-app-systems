You gain the following benefits:\n\n- You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).\n- If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have one superiority die, which is a d6.
