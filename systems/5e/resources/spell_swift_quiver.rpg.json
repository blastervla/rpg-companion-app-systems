Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends."},"classes":{"value":["ranger__revised__","revised_ranger","ranger"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.664325"}}}
