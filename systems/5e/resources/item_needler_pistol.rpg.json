The weapon is powered by an energy cell stored at the base of the flask. Placing a full energy cell in the pistol gives the pistol 10 charges.\n\nAs an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a burst of glowing, needlelike darts from the pistol in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d4 piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nReplacing the Energy Cell:\n\nWhile the pistol has charges remaining, its energy cell can't be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action."},"type":{"value":"adventuring_gear"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"9dabef49-bfbd-4e1b-93c0-23afad8bf96b","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.738135"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"2309ad92-a284-4234-b109-ec1b380eb0aa","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.738139"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.738141"}}}
