Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\n\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell.
