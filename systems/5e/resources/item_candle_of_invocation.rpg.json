The candle's alignment can be detected with the detect evil and good spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.\n\nd20 --> Alignment\n1-2 --> Chaotic evil\n3-4 --> Chaotic neutral\n5-7 --> Chaotic good\n8-9 --> Neutral evil\n10-11 --> Neutral\n12-13 --> Neutral good\n14-15 --> Lawful evil\n16-17 --> Lawful neutral\n18-20 --> Lawful good\n\nThe candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.\n\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\n\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.662781"},"id":"5c842c3e-b153-4391-8e5a-25812039fb82"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.662786"},"id":"01763782-b533-4674-823b-28be65f43c6f"}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast Gate (Destroy Candle Afterwards)"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"6961885d-7244-4a38-9c8e-8fdacfe7cbb4"}}},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"id":"bf07b03b-1a96-4c4e-83ad-803bc28b68cb"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Gate"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_9"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_conjuration"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"60 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 1 minute"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp"},"description":{"value":"You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see whithin range to a precise location on a different plane of existence.
