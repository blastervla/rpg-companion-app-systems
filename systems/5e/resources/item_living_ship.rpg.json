The treant has a speed of 0 because its roots are woven into the deck; it and the ship are inseparable. If the ship is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant dies of shock. The ship can function if its treant dies, but the treant can never be replaced with another.\n\nWhen the treant finishes a long rest, it repairs the ship's hull, enabling the ship to regain 4d12 hit points, and refreshes the ship's air envelope (turning deadly air into foul air, or foul air into fresh air).\n\nA living ship can float on water and sail across it, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). Its standard weaponry is an aft-mounted ballista."},"type":{"value":"vehicle_space"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":2500.0},"unit":{"value":"platinum"},"id":"a045ba36-adf8-4a15-9c16-924025ed9970","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.691292"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"a1015293-eb17-4fb6-b53f-ddaf31b1ddba","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.691296"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.691299"}}}
