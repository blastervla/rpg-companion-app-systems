While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.\n- The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.\n\nWhen all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"05dd9656-d76b-46af-9416-645874432718","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786256"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"c86c2392-d0b6-4433-b021-d6b7527b023a","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786260"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"manual"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":50},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":0},"id":"719d8b81-8970-41fd-bbc7-100741530ed7","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786268"}}}},"type":{"value":"none"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"id":"5475ade4-9880-4742-bdbb-14154026355f","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786273"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.786275"}}}
