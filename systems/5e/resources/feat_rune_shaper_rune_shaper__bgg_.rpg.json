You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have.\n\n- Rune Magic: You know a number of runes equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), chosen from the Rune Spells table. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can inscribe each rune you know onto one nonmagical weapon, armor, piece of clothing, or other object you touch. You temporarily learn the 1st-level spells that correspond to the runes you inscribed, as specified on the Rune Spells table, and you know those spells until you finish a long rest, when the runes fade. While you are wearing or carrying any rune-marked object, you can cast the spells associated with those runes using any spell slots you have.\nYou can also invoke a rune inscribed on an object you are wearing or carrying and cast its associated spell without expending a spell slot or using material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this feat is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).\nEach time you gain a level, you can replace one of the runes you know with another one from the Rune Spells table.\n\nRune --> Spell\nCloud --> Fog cloud\nDeath --> Inflict wounds\nDragon --> Chromatic orb\nEnemy --> Disguise self\nFire --> Burning hands\nFriend --> Speak with animals\nFrost --> Armor of Agathys\nHill --> Goodberry\nJourney --> Longstrider\nKing --> Command\nMountain --> Entangle\nStone --> Sanctuary\nStorm --> Thunderwave"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:28.415639"},"id":"00b46846-505e-4ed6-b85e-9b1673b720e5"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"900d0824-2b57-42df-9001-006286e8ceee"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"type":{"value":"add_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Comprehend Languages"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_1"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_divination"},"ritual":{"value":true},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"Self"},"duration":{"value":"1 hour"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"material":{"value":true},"components":{"value":"a pinch of soot and salt"},"description":{"value":"For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear.
