The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\nWhen the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nThe cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns."},"classes":{"value":["sorcerer","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":8},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":10},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"constant":{"value":0},"id":"43339305-524e-43aa-ba43-32172400a8e7","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640440"}}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"fire"},"id":"21030522-cbce-4ca3-af8a-9bf5ae2a29d9","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640445"}}}]},"id":"24dbe35a-a9ae-4a8b-9212-e8c3dd56b002","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640450"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.640453"}}}
