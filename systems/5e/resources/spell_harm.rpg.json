The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."},"classes":{"value":["cleric"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":6},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":14},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"constant":{"value":0},"id":"e746a5a7-3903-4839-bfed-13254aeab736","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.656040"}}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"necrotic"},"id":"2d564bee-271b-48f4-9d6a-6d1ff8428566","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.656045"}}}]},"id":"3953a8f8-1470-41d7-b900-f59e10d4ead6","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.656050"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.656053"}}}
