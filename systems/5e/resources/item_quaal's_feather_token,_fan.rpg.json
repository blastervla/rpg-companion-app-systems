Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect.\n\nFan\nIf you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.715476"},"id":"58e4edf2-6280-4125-a6fe-904fd45254fe"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.715480"},"id":"8f5fc756-d15a-44f3-a33b-5c530c8dc0b5"}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.715483"},"id":"quaals_feather_token,_fan"}}
