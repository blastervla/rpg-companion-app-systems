When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower's hand.\n\nOnce the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"id":"cd3b69d7-8b3d-45ed-98b8-a8ed35c481c2"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"id":"e2989962-e843-4a7a-9757-72d2b04e16de"}}},"type":{"value":"javelin"},"attack_ability":{"value":"dexterity"},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"is_range":{"value":true},"range":{"value":"60/120"},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"id":"40894260-115f-4953-b5f0-e3a64c51dd3f"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"id":"b2a07841-9834-4b99-b2df-136b1cfcb3fc"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Thunder charge"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"1ff2d772-3c69-4238-b03a-97ec5241b486"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"manual"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"id":"e090aa91-8636-4c31-a955-60baaf47ecf9"}}]},"id":"8ecce90e-1f4f-4683-9c09-754ecb1cee4a"}}
