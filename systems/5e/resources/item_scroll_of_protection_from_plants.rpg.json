For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents plants from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a plant would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier."},"type":{"value":"scroll"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"40107916-dc25-4cba-926e-275f6c147ebf","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.814576"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"7788c1e4-2305-4054-9349-40a1f7e3733f","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.814581"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.814584"}}}
