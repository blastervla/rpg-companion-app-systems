Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube\ncentered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.\n\nGrasses and Undergrowth. Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.\n\nTrees. At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.\n\nRoots and Vines. At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nRocks. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone"},"classes":{"value":["druid","ranger"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":5},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":4},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.691569"},"id":"06818e14-0175-4e8d-9496-03f328964159"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"slashing"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.691573"},"id":"4feaa48c-5752-4578-b537-4b69b2bfcb36"}},{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":3},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"id":"6aaba4cd-d995-45c9-aa44-f3ce0c7ff466"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"id":"ba4fd358-c884-4a31-b8f8-f590a756c8c7"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.691577"},"id":"6181e93c-e7bc-43a7-94a9-5d93c63868f6"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.691580"},"id":"wrath_of_nature"}}
