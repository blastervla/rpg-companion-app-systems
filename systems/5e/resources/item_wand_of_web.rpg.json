Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\n\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength cheek against your spell save DC.
