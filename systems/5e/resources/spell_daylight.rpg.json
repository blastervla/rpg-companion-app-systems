Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\n\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled."},"classes":{"value":["cleric","druid","ranger__revised__","revised_ranger","ranger","sorcerer"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.631207"}}}
