It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.\n\nPanicked: The target is Frightened of you. On each of its turns, the Frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this Effect ends.\n\nSickened: The target has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks.
