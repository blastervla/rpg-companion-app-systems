The weapon is powered by an energy cell stored in its grip. Placing a full energy cell in the pistol gives the pistol 6 charges.\n\nAs an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a ray of crackling energy at a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the paralyzed condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nReplacing the Energy Cell:\n\nWhile the pistol has charges remaining, its energy cell can't be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action."},"type":{"value":"adventuring_gear"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"d25a5f7c-c161-4785-b858-8423c21615e2","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.679393"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"31b0472f-4d8e-4c9b-9726-54ea55f770ce","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.679398"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.679401"}}}
