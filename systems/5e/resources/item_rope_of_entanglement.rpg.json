{"resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Rope of Entanglement"},"source":{"value":"dmg"},"description":{"value":"This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.\n\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\n\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.713934"},"id":"c687330e-5c7e-4270-8fbe-7bcb623ff868"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":3},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.713938"},"id":"4cdf6da9-cc64-4111-a9b0-1699466ae2c2"}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.713940"},"id":"rope_of_entanglement"}}
