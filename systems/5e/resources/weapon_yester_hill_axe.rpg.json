{"resource_id":"weapon","stats":{"name":{"value":"Yester Hill Axe"},"source":{"value":"cos"},"description":{"value":"The axe's handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra 1d8 slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"3eaa4936-eabe-44c9-be4d-606f7bd26ad6"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":2},"id":"62ddb4bb-a038-404a-9d0f-0f5d53e3e79f"}}},"type":{"value":"battleaxe"},"rarity":{"value":"unknown"},"is_simple":{"value":false},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"id":"ec7422d3-2a16-48f8-8ccb-181eb5681e5f"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"slashing"},"id":"96cce413-a61b-43e8-97fd-cfa5c3883498"}}]},"is_versatile":{"value":true},"versatile_damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d10"},"id":"9f84be1b-09a5-40f7-9e9d-b6d83b0a7413"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"slashing"},"id":"19358da5-d6d3-4563-b55b-98284814776e"}}]},"id":"f05ee902-c101-4250-a6b6-c58e058db07e"}}
