{"resource_id":"item","stats":{"id":"oil__flask_","name":{"value":"Oil (flask)"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"description":{"value":"Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn."},"type":{"value":"adventuring_gear"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":1.0},"unit":{"value":"silver"},"id":"0d49f56e-25dd-455b-b416-dbea42b862c8","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.669311"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"0e020fc9-7e70-4e8a-bad9-b91454c8a801","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.669316"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.669319"}}}
