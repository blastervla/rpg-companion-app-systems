{"resource_id":"weapon","stats":{"name":{"value":"Gulthias Staff"},"source":{"value":"cos"},"description":{"value":"Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree, a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.\n\nIf the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.\n\nVampiric Strike. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short term madness.\n\nBlight Bane. While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"1341269d-d786-4fbd-b887-9bf39d0c9578"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":4},"id":"7e629b7c-bfce-42c8-bc7e-535649dd4251"}}},"type":{"value":"quarterstaff"},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"id":"24447863-8c98-4d2f-905e-8ac7bec0f5a6"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"id":"b7904584-f706-4cee-ac95-9715cda99eaa"}}]},"is_versatile":{"value":true},"versatile_damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"id":"f8aa42bc-8d33-464a-8f7e-640b3752ab5c"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"bludgeoning"},"id":"98a3be1d-18bb-44f2-ac03-1698a4d06b59"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"f47998dc-9d7a-4fc7-8136-4c192f33387b"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dusk"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":10},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"constant":{"value":4},"id":"36c0c796-900e-4a7d-8cb4-39c5b4567119"}}},"id":"d41902ba-6f6c-4710-99fe-ed99f8900d04"}}]},"id":"c9f3ad6c-c6b6-428f-b7dd-4911fa6d9f57"}}
