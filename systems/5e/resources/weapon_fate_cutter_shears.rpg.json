The shears function as a magic dagger. The weapon has the following properties:\n\nEver Sharp. When you hit with an attack using the shears, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.\n\nSever Threads. When you hit a creature with the shears, you can cut that creature's fate. Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":2},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"bedd4df9-4531-4790-b793-bd6b30df528c"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1},"id":"9580b1ff-2fb3-4f78-ad69-91b6a99be066"}}},"type":{"value":"dagger"},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_finesse":{"value":true},"is_thrown":{"value":true},"thrown_range":{"value":"20/60"},"is_light":{"value":true},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"id":"c073924e-65a6-4fce-9a01-d4d15096cc7c"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"piercing"},"id":"bff1d99a-c33d-4733-a607-9c1e5420a8bc"}},{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"id":"4db0506f-dcdb-4af3-85c5-cec074828aea"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"force"},"id":"fd514333-6f2b-4a8b-8634-ec5a535a1f31"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Sever Threads uses"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"7ce76bb8-c826-4478-80b9-893368a8ca09"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"id":"4625502e-bde6-4a8b-b698-c6c3818a9788"}}]},"id":"11e298cd-c45f-49ea-a552-f9672213401f"}}
