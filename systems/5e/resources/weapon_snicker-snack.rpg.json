{"resource_id":"weapon","stats":{"name":{"value":"Snicker-Snack"},"source":{"value":"wbtw"},"description":{"value":"(requires attunement by a non-evil creature)\n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic vorpal sword. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn't have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\n\nWhile attuned to Snicker-Snack, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.\n\nSentience. Snicker-Snack is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. Snicker-Snack craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them.\n\nSnicker-Snack has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword's trust by making a contested Charisma check against Snicker-Snack. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can't be restored in any other way"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"30075354-30c7-482e-9cbe-c2a2fb098284"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":6},"id":"26635890-50a0-4413-a730-59a36628fc5c"}}},"type":{"value":"greatsword"},"rarity":{"value":"legendary"},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_simple":{"value":false},"is_two_handed":{"value":true},"is_heavy":{"value":true},"extra_attack_bonus":{"value":3},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":2},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"constant":{"value":3},"id":"99189597-8ed6-4082-99f6-5f48023c8e0c"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"slashing"},"id":"628cd4b8-d7f6-4840-9382-16d61fab6665"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Beheader"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"8112cf64-258b-41aa-972c-0d05a8592327"}}},"id":"526805dd-174d-4945-b24a-0d7b7e304150"}}]},"id":"2b6f4e42-87ff-4b43-9963-f6153bcbe4bb"}}
