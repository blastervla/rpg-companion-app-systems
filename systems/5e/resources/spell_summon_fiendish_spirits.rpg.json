The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Fiendish Spirit stat block below.

The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration.
