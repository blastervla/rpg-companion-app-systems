It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\n\n- You have advantage on saving throws against spells.\n- The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one.
