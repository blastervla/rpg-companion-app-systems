{"resource_id":"weapon","stats":{"name":{"value":"Blade of Avernus"},"source":{"value":"bgdia"},"description":{"value":"You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.\n\nWhen you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\n\nRandom Properties. The sword has the following randomly determined properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 major detrimental property, which is suppressed while the sword is attuned to an archdevil\n\nRuler of Avernus. As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability. If you command the devil to do something it perceives as suicidal, the effect ends and you can no longer use this power of the sword against that devil.\n\nInfernal Recall. As an action, you can use the sword to cast word of recall. Creatures transported by this spell appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the current ruler of Avernus, or a sanctuary you designate if you rule Avernus.\n\nDestroying the Sword. The sword can be destroyed by casting it into the River Styx or melting it down in the forge that created it"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"id":"218df83a-878b-4e54-b0d8-aa59f544e2a8"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":3},"id":"0a56daa2-6db5-401f-825c-c960e251ba10"}}},"type":{"value":"longsword"},"rarity":{"value":"artifact"},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_simple":{"value":false},"extra_attack_bonus":{"value":3},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"constant":{"value":3},"id":"6533f19b-40b5-4afa-ae22-2ae309615902"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"slashing"},"id":"6234ff7a-bed8-41ec-8440-4c138929d1c3"}}]},"is_versatile":{"value":true},"versatile_damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d10"},"constant":{"value":3},"id":"9af0b3e4-c78e-40ec-b52e-2f7249e8b6cf"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"slashing"},"id":"cd809f69-3f35-433b-8288-49bbe6373830"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast word of recall"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"658ab254-10bd-40ff-9f81-a63f2367b55c"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Word of Recall"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_6"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_conjuration"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"5 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Instantaneous"},"verbal":{"value":true},"description":{"value":"You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.
