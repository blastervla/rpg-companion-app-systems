The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\\n4. Slowing Ray.

In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\\n5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. In any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.\\nIf the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. In any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.\\n7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.\\n8. Petrification Ray.

On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\\n9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.\\nIf the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw.
