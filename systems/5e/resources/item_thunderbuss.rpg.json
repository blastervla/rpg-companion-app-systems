You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It requires no ammunition, its damage is thunder instead of piercing, and it doesn't have the loading property.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon's rune to launch a ball of energy to a point you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage, and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.\n\nIt's up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. During their downtime, characters can train to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use."},"type":{"value":"weapon"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"122a8215-6ec4-4aaf-a939-e7c7de117e63","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.820115"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":3.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"c50e2409-9db5-4459-963d-dbbdc8865e47","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.820120"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[null,null,{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Invoke Rune"},"trigger_type":{"value":"passive"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"all"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":1},"id":"466adfbf-8359-4bc6-8cc7-7e0a2e34e87b","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.820131"}}}},"type":{"value":"none"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"id":"cfc6af2a-fd19-47a5-a77c-04ff70244f5d","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.820136"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.820138"}}}
