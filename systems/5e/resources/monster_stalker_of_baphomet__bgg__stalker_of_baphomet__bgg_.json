You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached.

Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM\u2019s discretion.\n\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled.
