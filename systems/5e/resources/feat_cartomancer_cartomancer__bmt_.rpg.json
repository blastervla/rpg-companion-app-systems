You can use a card deck as your spellcasting focus, and you gain the following benefits:\n\n- Card Tricks: You learn the Prestidigitation cantrip and can use it to create illusions that duplicate the effects of stage magic. When you use Prestidigitation in this way, you can conceal the verbal and somatic components of the spell as ordinary conversation and card handling.\n\n- Hidden Ace: When you finish a long rest, you can choose one spell from your class's spell list and imbue that spell into a card. The chosen spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and it must be a level for which you have spell slots. The card remains imbued with this spell for 8 hours. While the card is imbued with the spell, you can use a bonus action to flourish the card and cast the spell within. The card then immediately loses its magic"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:28.425151"},"id":"9c0f8312-27e0-4ca5-9128-b204285528c7"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"59d28e82-7347-416c-8380-f4ad4923a0bd"}}},"type":{"value":"add_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Prestidigitation"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_transmutation"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"10 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Up to 1 hour"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"description":{"value":"* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\n\n* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\n\n* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\n\n* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\n\n* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\n\n* You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.\n\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action."},"classes":{"value":["artificer__eb_","artificer__revised_","bard","sorcerer","warlock","blood_hunter","fighter","rogue","wizard"]},"dice":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.619420"},"id":"b7243191-27c8-4b4e-9665-b8bb3431240a"}}},"id":"9bad7d1f-20d6-40b2-bbf4-439e4f35d169"}}},"id":"2b8ab191-ec25-4dfb-9a15-e5d1b5531145"}},{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Hidden Ace"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"4a29cf93-0476-4e15-b19e-f284a6ab0dc5"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"id":"c2304eec-b0c1-44e7-a4e3-7785fccf37df"}}},"id":"09a10418-3f6b-412e-aab1-5ed0bd0a5751"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:28.425154"},"id":"cartomancer__bmt_"}}
