If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.\n\nIf the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC is 16. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\n\nA spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of 17 and an attack bonus of 9.\n\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed."},"type":{"value":"scroll"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"5b9faa8e-3754-454b-ae8e-09dee30f300c","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.772512"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"568e36cd-fcb6-49f8-a73f-802e80c6894d","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.772517"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.772520"}}}
