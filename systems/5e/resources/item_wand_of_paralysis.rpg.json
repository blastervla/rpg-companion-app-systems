While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed."},"type":{"value":"wand"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.617368"},"id":"0dceefc8-8263-49f9-96e6-eef786118068"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":1.0},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.617374"},"id":"0dbfa40d-758f-40e2-bfc0-673c31d3b156"}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Uses"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":7},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"constant":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.617384"},"id":"605ec6fb-73a5-4ce6-bbdd-eb316c98441b"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.617391"},"id":"294531fc-35ed-4b76-b9e9-744e892eb4f6"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.617394"},"id":"wand_of_paralysis"}}
