Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs or in water-resistant powder horns.\n\nSetting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet."},"type":{"value":"explosive"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":35.0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"52c0f03b-b4ae-4a67-8138-ee45dcb71641","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.702442"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":2},"unit":{"value":"ounces"},"id":"84ae9f5f-5497-43f2-a6b8-fe21f519387a","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.702446"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.702448"}}}
