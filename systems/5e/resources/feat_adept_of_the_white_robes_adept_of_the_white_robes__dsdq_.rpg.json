The 2nd-level spell must be from the abjuration or divination school of magic. You can cast this feat's 2nd-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spell's spellcasting ability is the one chosen when you gained the Initiate of High Sorcery feat.\n\n- Protective Ward: When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot and weave protective magic around the target.
