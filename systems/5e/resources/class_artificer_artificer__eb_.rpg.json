When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSPELLCASTING ABILITY\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells: your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an at tack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nRITUAL CASTING\nYou can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared."},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.447338"},"id":"9608a02d-908e-4005-8659-dec1ff442948"}},{"resource_id":"levelled_description","stats":{"level":{"value":17},"description":{"value":"You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects.
