The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.\n\nWhen a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage."},"classes":{"value":["cleric"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":6},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":6},"dice_type":{"value":"d10"},"constant":{"value":0},"id":"e1c849e4-4150-457c-ba39-f0299f41f7c7","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.647655"}}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"magic"},"id":"ad23ca51-15f6-4e94-b594-04486a94df4d","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.647660"}}}]},"id":"bc4c557a-1388-4b63-af02-438b62f4d185","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.647665"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.647667"}}}
