While this bond lasts, whenever you are subjected to a spell or magical effect that restores hit points, the bonded creature also receives the benefits of the spell or effect.\n\nYou can bond with a different creature whenever you finish a long rest, provided that you can touch the creature and the creature is willing.\n\nA creature can benefit from only one ring of amity's bond at a time. The bond ends if either you or the creature travels to a different plane of existence, if you bond with a different creature at the end of a long rest, or if you sever the bond as a bonus action.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nWhen the bonded creature hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the ring's rune if you are within 60 feet of the bonded creature. The bonded creature's attack is then turned into a critical hit.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn."},"type":{"value":"ring"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"75bdff09-a4f7-4702-87a3-36f3dca51718","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.706756"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":0},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"8a093b2d-aa59-4495-89b3-a5818d93a570","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.706760"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Invoke Rune"},"trigger_type":{"value":"passive"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"charge_type":{"value":"constant"},"recharge_type":{"value":"all"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":0},"dice_type":{"value":"d4"},"constant":{"value":1},"id":"525c50f1-abe1-4421-b4ab-8983de3f5901","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.706768"}}}},"type":{"value":"none"},"events":{"value":""},"stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"id":"9576a2b1-1008-4264-8b8f-a28385e44b1f","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.706776"}}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.706778"}}}
