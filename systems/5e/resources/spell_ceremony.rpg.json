On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.\n\n- Bless Water: You touch one vial of water and cause it to become holy water.\n\n- Coming of Age: You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.\n\n- Dedication: You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god’s service.
