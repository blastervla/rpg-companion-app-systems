For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents aberrations from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that an aberration would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier."},"type":{"value":"scroll"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"9725d6d5-4b45-42e1-a149-266b8263b276","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.817141"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"6d736c81-415c-4763-bb1b-048344dd5bd3","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.817146"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.817149"}}}
