For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents fiends from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a fiend would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier."},"type":{"value":"scroll"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"gold"},"id":"44b95c94-9845-4412-b039-fc835cba393e","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.696552"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":null},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"382fff87-028d-404e-8b74-290b6d6b70c9","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.696557"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"rare"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.696559"}}}
