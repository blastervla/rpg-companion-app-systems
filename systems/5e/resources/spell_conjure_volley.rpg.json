Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon."},"classes":{"value":["revised_ranger","ranger"]},"dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_damage_dice","stats":{"level":{"value":5},"damage_dice":{"value":[{"resource_id":"damage_dice","stats":{"dices":{"value":[{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":8},"dice_type":{"value":"d8"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.649209"},"id":"9b5e17d2-a367-48b1-bd24-95cbc8bba641"}}]},"damage_type":{"value":"magic"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.649215"},"id":"f2f70ad0-f677-418e-878c-19f51a5d95d8"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.649220"},"id":"866e8998-c0b3-42ec-af99-2e9dea82c92f"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:46.649223"},"id":"conjure_volley"}}
