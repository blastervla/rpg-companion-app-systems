Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs or in water-resistant powder horns.\n\nSetting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it (7d6 for a keg). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet."},"type":{"value":"explosive"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"value":{"value":25.0},"unit":{"value":"platinum"},"id":"c2f96114-41f6-446a-9770-566bfc09d0ea","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.810622"}}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"value":{"value":20},"unit":{"value":"pounds"},"id":"8bbf5243-927f-4cab-be10-c8b57de0a007","updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.810627"}}}},"rarity":{"value":"none"},"is_magic":{"value":false},"requires_attunement":{"value":false},"is_cursed":{"value":false},"is_intelligent":{"value":false},"is_spellcasting_focus":{"value":false},"effects":{"value":[]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.810629"}}}
