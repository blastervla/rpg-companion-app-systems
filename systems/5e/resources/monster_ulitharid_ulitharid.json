A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.\n\nOn subsequent rounds, you can use your Action to attempt to maintain your Telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.\n\nObject: You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.\n\nIf the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your Spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.\n\nYou can exert fine control on Objects with your Telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the Contents from a vial"}, "classes": {"value": ["sorcerer", "fighter", "rogue", "wizard"]}, "dice": {"value": []}, "updated_at": {"value": "2024-12-20T18:50:46.664429"}}}, {"resource_id": "spell", "stats": {"id": "scrying", "name": {"value": "Scrying"}, "source": {"value": "phb"}, "level": {"value": "spell_level_5"}, "school": {"value": "spell_school_divination"}, "ritual": {"value": false}, "casting_time": {"value": "10 minutes"}, "range": {"value": "Self"}, "duration": {"value": "Concentration, up to 10 minutes"}, "verbal": {"value": true}, "somatic": {"value": true}, "material": {"value": true}, "components": {"value": "a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water"}, "description": {"value": "You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you.
