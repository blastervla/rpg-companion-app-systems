{"resource_id":"item","stats":{"name":{"value":"Deck of Dimensions"},"source":{"value":"bmt"},"description":{"value":"The backs of the cards in this deck are decorated with intricate designs representing different planes of existence. The deck has 6 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use the following properties:\n\n- Marked Card: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to draw a card from the deck and place it in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The card then becomes marked with an invisible sigil. Once within the next 24 hours, as an action, you can speak the marked card's name and teleport to the card's location, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, appearing in the closest unoccupied space to the card. After you teleport in this way, or after 8 hours, the card returns to the deck, and the mark on it fades.\n- Riffling Portal: As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast the Arcane Gate spell from the deck. The deck vanishes, and fluttering cards create the spell's portal rings. When the spell ends, the deck reappears in your possession.\n- Shuffling Stride: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to throw a card from the deck to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of yourself and teleport, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, to that space. The card then vanishes and returns to the deck.\nThe deck regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn."},"type":{"value":"wondrous"},"cost":{"value":{"resource_id":"cost","stats":{"unit":{"value":"gold"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.677565"},"id":"fb3e4697-ae0c-4c22-8ccc-f70374593264"}}},"weight":{"value":{"resource_id":"weight","stats":{"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.677570"},"id":"06d6e356-9064-43bb-a4ea-d23cbca067c4"}}},"rarity":{"value":"very_rare"},"is_magic":{"value":true},"requires_attunement":{"value":true},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Charges Left"},"has_charges":{"value":true},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharge_event":{"value":"dawn"},"max_charges_constant":{"value":6},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"dice_amount":{"value":1},"dice_type":{"value":"d6"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.677579"},"id":"a54b8176-ea53-414e-bbe0-13e85bc011ce"}}},"advantage_stat":{"value":"$character.strength_score"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-20T18:50:35.677584"},"id":"1800dc61-e1d4-4d67-8a45-ef461a0d0e2b"}},{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Cast Arcane Gate (3 Charges)"},"trigger_type":{"value":"active"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"12ef5f5a-6f3e-4357-afc3-ae3efc9fdb77"}}},"recharge_type":{"value":"formula"},"recharges":{"value":{"resource_id":"dice_roll","stats":{"id":"4740e206-5dd4-4d61-9eb6-81aca787bbea"}}},"type":{"value":"use_spell"},"spell":{"value":{"resource_id":"spell","stats":{"name":{"value":"Arcane Gate"},"source":{"value":"phb"},"level":{"value":"spell_level_6"},"school":{"value":"spell_school_conjuration"},"casting_time":{"value":"1 action"},"range":{"value":"500 feet"},"duration":{"value":"Concentration, up to 10 minutes"},"verbal":{"value":true},"somatic":{"value":true},"description":{"value":"You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration.
