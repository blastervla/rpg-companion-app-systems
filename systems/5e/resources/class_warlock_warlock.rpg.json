You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\n\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\n\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks."},"id":"7926524c-246c-4def-bd56-0ac6538deb61"}}]},"id":"b4e52650-864d-44a3-b314-951ae15b4bbf"}},{"resource_id":"feat","stats":{"name":{"value":"Pact of the Chain"},"descriptions":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_description","stats":{"level":{"value":3},"description":{"value":"You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual.

Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.\n\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\n\nYou can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list.

Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit's space (your choice).\n\nWhile projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:\n\n- Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n- When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn't require verbal or somatic components or material components that lack a gold cost.\n\n- You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.\n\n- While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest"},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.518950"},"id":"a0fd7d9f-48b7-471d-bc8d-37adf5ba0102"}}]},"effects":{"value":[{"resource_id":"levelled_effect","stats":{"level":{"value":14},"effect":{"value":{"resource_id":"effect","stats":{"name":{"value":"Uses"},"trigger_condition":{"value":{"resource_id":"trigger_condition_or","stats":{"id":"7d00fe12-00ff-447d-b922-28491d9a2923"}}},"has_charges":{"value":true},"max_charges_constant":{"value":1},"id":"dd319554-6d02-49b4-932b-90617de31978"}}},"id":"8071259a-5295-4de7-94ba-00337a00630c"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.518952"},"id":"spirit_projection"}}]},"weapon":{"value":[]},"attacks_per_action_per_level":{"value":[]},"language_proficiencies":{"value":[]},"skill_proficiencies":{"value":[]},"armor_proficiencies":{"value":[]},"weapon_proficiencies":{"value":[]},"tool_proficiencies":{"value":[]},"selectable_armors":{"value":[]},"selectable_weapons":{"value":[]},"archetype_selection_level":{"value":1},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.519003"},"id":"warlock_the_undead_[vrgr]"}}]},"updated_at":{"value":"2024-12-27T17:49:29.519006"},"id":"warlock"}}
