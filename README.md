# RPG Companion App – Open Systems Repository

Welcome to the **community repository** for the [RPG Companion App](https://rpg-companion.app)!  
This repo hosts **RPG systems** compatible with the app.

Our goal is to make tabletop gaming more open, flexible, and customizable — so anyone can design, share, and play their own systems within the app.
